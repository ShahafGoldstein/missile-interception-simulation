# Missile Interception Simulation

This project presents a MATLAB-based simulation of a ballistic missile interception system under uncertainty.

The simulation models the missile trajectory while incorporating:
- Process noise in the motion model
- Measurement noise in the sensor
- State estimation using a Kalman Filter / Extended Kalman Filter

## Main Features
- Ballistic missile trajectory modeling
- Noisy measurements and stochastic disturbances
- Kalman Filter-based state estimation
- Innovation and estimation error analysis
- Performance evaluation (RMSE and covariance convergence)

## Technologies & Tools
- MATLAB
- State-space modeling
- Stochastic processes
- Kalman Filtering

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run `missile_interception_simulation_ballistic_rmse.m`
